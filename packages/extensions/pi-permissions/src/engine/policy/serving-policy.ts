/**
 * The serving node's recorded authority over a forwarded request: the
 * child-fixed facts (ADR 0008) resolved against this node's composed ruleset,
 * agent-scoped to the requester (`principal.agentName`, §3), with the floor the
 * child raised honored.
 *
 * A bash chain is judged unit by unit: the child names its winner in
 * `matchValues`, but this answer approves the whole tool call, so every unit the
 * child left asking (`askingUnits`) is resolved with its own floor and the most
 * restrictive answer decides (#1030). A request without units (an older child,
 * or an ask raised without a chain) is judged on its single value.
 *
 * The `matchValues` are used as the child fixed them, never re-derived through
 * this session's `PathNormalizer`/cwd. The resolver's surface-family fold is
 * what keeps a parent's bare `path` deny answering a child's request, which is
 * why this goes through `resolve` rather than the manager directly (#712, #806).
